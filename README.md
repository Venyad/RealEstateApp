Project Description: Real Estate Application using MERN Stack

Introduction:
Our project aims to develop a comprehensive Real Estate application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. This application will serve as a platform for users to browse, search, and interact with property listings seamlessly. Whether you're a potential buyer looking for your dream home, a seller wishing to list properties, or a real estate agent facilitating transactions, our application caters to all stakeholders in the real estate market.
